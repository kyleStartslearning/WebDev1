    <h1>"A Hand-Made Wallet"</h1>
    <p>
        An ill child was brought to a hospital. After her treatment, the mother showed the doctor a hand-made wallet and said:<br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;"There are things we can't pay. I hope you take this wallet I made for you."<br><br>
        The doctor said:<br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;"I don't practice for sentimental reasons. Pay me P10000."<br><br>
        The lady opened the wallet, took out P50000 and gave the doctor P10000. Then she replied:<br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;"You are a very good doctor but I wish you were a better person."
