    <h1>What is your purpose in life?</h1>
    <p>My purpose in life is to improve myself, gain knowledge, and become the best version of who I am. I strive to build inner strength, find fulfillment, and pursue my dreams with passion and determination. I also want to help my family by supporting them, bringing them happiness, and being there whenever they need me.</p>
